# DeepRL-PRJ-Navigation
This project repository contains my work for the Udacity's Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Project 1: Navigation.

### Project Description
For this project, we will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.The world contains both yellow and blue bananas.

### Reward
A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. 

### State Space
The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction

### Action
The agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:<br/>
. 0 - move forward.<br/>
. 1 - move backward.<br/>
. 2 - turn left.<br/>
. 3 - turn right.<br/>

### Project Goal
The goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas. 
The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
